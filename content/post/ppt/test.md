# Markdown.js

* Provided by [Markdown.js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js) 
  in [extras/](https://github.com/henrikingo/impress.js/tree/myfork/extras)
* Jot down your bullet points in *Markdown* & have it automatically converted to HTML
* Note: The Markdown is converted into a presentation client side, in the browser.
  This is unlike existing tools like [Hovercraft](https://github.com/regebro/hovercraft) 
  and [markdown-impress](http://binbinliao.com/markdown-impress/) where you generate 
  a new html file on the command line.
* This combines the ease of --- typing Markdown with the full power of 
  impress.js HTML5+CSS3+JavaScript!

-----
# Styles

* You can use *italics* & **bold**
* ...and `code`
